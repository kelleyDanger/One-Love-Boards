	<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>First off, let me begin by saying that I had a lot of fun doing this project.  For one thing, it really helped me refine my coding.  Looking upon my coding, it is very well organized and neat.  In particular, there is very little html code; most of the real work is done in the css as it should be.  There is still room for improvement in my organization.  I feel that the addition of more comments would be a very reasonable solution in the future.  Indentation also needs to be more focused on.</p>
		<p>As for the content, I feel that I accurately summed up my knowledge on the subject.  I included lots of information written in my own words that spans a broad spanse of knowledge.  I made sure that all of my information was relevant, precise, and easy to read.  The easy to follow navigation added to overall effectiveness of my content in that everything was very easy to find and read.</p>
		<p>Complimenting all of my text were nicely coordinated images.  All of them were edited in some shape or form in an image manipulator such as photoshop and gimp.  Some were simply cropped and resized while others went through a few extra steps such as contrast, hue/saturation, and clone tool.  Overall, I feel that I made a very nicely laid out and effective website.  It fulfilled all of the hopes I expressed in my mission statement.  The two things that could use improvement are:
		<ol>
			<li>Improve the pink color of my banner's background color + make the transparent gradient more bold</li>
			<li>Make the headers more bold and large</li>
		</ol></p>
