				<li class="heading">Speedboarding</li>
					
						The goal here is speed, so boards are designed with stability in mind. They tend to have a rigid deck which is lowered significantly. They have large wheels and large trucks as well.
					
				<li class="heading">Cruising</li>
					
						The goal here is a smooth easy ride. These longboards are designed to be responsive and stable at low speeds. The decks usually have quite a bit of flex in them and are still long like a speedboard. They tend to have slightly harder wheels than a speedboard but still relatively the same size. They are very smooth and easy to ride because they bend as you carve, sticking you to your board as you corner quickly.
						
				<li class="heading">Sliding</li>
					
						These boards are designed for sliding. They are usually fairly short and have kicktails on the front and the back. They have small hard wheels that slide very easily.
					
				<li class="heading">Carving</li>
					
						These boards are designed to carve really tight and fast. They have a shorter wheelbase than a cruiser and turn a lot faster too. They have wide soft wheels for maximum traction. People usually use these boards in slalmom races.
