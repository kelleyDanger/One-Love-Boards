# One-Love-Boards

**Type:** Website
**Progress:** Complete


## Description
One of my first adventures into web design, my passion for longboards inspired this multi-paged website.  Prior to the design phase, competitive sites were researched, a list of pro and con features was generated, and much attention was paid to the audienceâ€™s needs and wants.  Meaningful and substantial content was produced, user-friendly navigation was put into place, images were manipulated using the GIMP software, and care was placed into cleaning, validating, and commenting all code.
